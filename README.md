## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me to understand some core concept of css grid and I was able to apply that knowledge to this project.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
.supervisor {
    grid-area: 2 / 1 / 4 / 2;
  }

  .team-builder {
    grid-area: 1 / 2 / 3 / 3;
  }

  .calculator {
    grid-area: 2 / 3 / 4 / 4;
  }

  .karma {
    grid-area: 3 / 2 / 5 / 3;
  }
```

### Continued development

I want to continue working on css grid and understand every concept on responsive design.
